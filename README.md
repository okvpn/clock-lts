# Clock

This package is a fork of the `lcobucci/clock` library that replaces it and adds feature support 
for a wider range of PHP versions (>= 7.2). Because this package contains only 3 simply classes, the break compatibility 
issue with a new php version is almost impossible.

## Installation

Package is available on Packagist, you can install it using Composer.

```sh 
composer require okvpn/clock-lts
```
